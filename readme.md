# InterplanetaryMemes: WIP

Currently the location of this page resides here: https://bafybeib3pyoo7wbkma64fvjzg6yxdbiyh5b4nhflhwzil7bnnf3vxwjyim.ipfs.sphn.link/

## Basics

I want to make this simple for people as possible. 
I have a github repo. When I save photos to a folder in the github repo, I want the photos added to public endpoint automatically. (currently I am thinking of a Github action) 

- All of this needs to be done using HTML only or we can also upgrade to React too since were doing this on IPFS(It looks like we will NEED React to make this work Dynamically)

## Install

- npm install

- npm start

## Essentially- 
I want to make this a super easy place to save cool memes in, and it gets added to ipfs and displayed in this easy to find page(add IPNS, probably with Cloudflare). 

Later we can add much cooler features ect. 


## Notes 

Due to the assignments each coming from an external gateway, running this in development mode means the images do not load when network is down. How could we make this work? Maybe this is more of a question how you host these types of website.
